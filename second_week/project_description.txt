We want to write a python application which can read a file of emails separated by ,
For instance: test1@gmail.com,test.tester@yahoo.com,....
create an output using generators, map, filter to:
1.  username:[EVERYTHING_BEFORE_at_WITHOUT_._ONLY_FOR_GMAIL]
2.  username:[EVERYTHING_BEFORE_at]
3. domain name: [EVERYTHING_AFTER_at]
4. use python classes and methods if possible.
